            "if you could go back and tell that 28-year-old version of yourself something about relationships or about marriage what would you tell that 28y old version it's not just the wedding right A lot of people when they say I I want to get married I'm looking to settle down are always thinking of just the wedding like it's like it's in the movies you know it's wedding end of movie happily ever after and uh but what marriage is is definitely companionship there is someone with you to witness your every days every little thing that happens in your day it shouldn't go unno someone should witness it it can be something as silly as what did you eat for lunch I sprain my toe today you're a very calm guy dude I'm someone who's diagnosed with ADHD so I have intrusive thoughts sometimes when I'm doing a podcast with people I visualize a train coming and running both of us over and all that's the curse of my head which is why all these random questions are being thrown at you wow okay but I mean I've I think experienced that once twice just like what you're sitting around you randomly like I think when I was promoting like the yesterday I I told this to other she was next to me what would be like if I just like killed over and collapsed like now or like or suddenly like I threw up or something would that be really weird Okay so after the things I'm looking likees do you get these kind of thoughts he's like no bro that's all it's dulgar Salman on TRS I'm not going to make this intro very long because I know a lot of you are his fans and yall are just watching TRS to know more about his mind but as with any of our film oriented episodes we've completely unlocked both his mind mind and his heart we've also gotten to his soul so you're going to enjoy this conversation I encourage you to make as many reels and shorts as is possible feel free to use the content all I'll say is that this was a very friendly easygoing conversation between two media Bros enjoy yourselves is dkar Salman on TRS [Music] DQ brother dkar Salman by Hi rir how are you bro I'm very well such a calm classy Vibe you have thank you a burning question for you man sure how do you have such beautiful hair I'm just glad it's still there dude it's gorgeous that's the first thing I noticed about you when I saw you ever like for the first time in life I was like this guy has damn and I still haven't done a Hair Commercial no no none of those products yet I'm like I should be doing this a lot of guys are age are struggling with a lot of image related I know my classmates and they all look at me like you have such good hair it's like they're like willing it to go away or something yeah I mean there is a concept called Nazar that probably really exists man yeah yeah I'm sure it's there as in uh definitely when I mean you know we definitely all believe in it and everything is going right you know there's a little fear of when is that one thing going to go wrong uh yeah I think that's there it's a cultural thing probably even a guy as positive as you thinks about what could go wrong I'm an overthinker big time really yeah yeah I mean I I believe in energies in the sense uh I always try to stay positive I I don't I learned quite early in life to cut off negative people uh I think the first time I read there with with a friend it was like one big eye opening moment for me I was like I'm fine like I I can make more friends he can make more friends maybe we just don't connect uh so all of these like little learnings you know when you as you like navigate through life we've had some crazy actors on the show uh and like I think the best ones I can't remember who said this on the show uh who was it who had said that you need to travel the world to actually be a good actor you need to have life experiences heavily punas The Party punas The Party said this on the show yeah and uh there was a very different energy about him and I don't I see somewhat of a younger parallel in you dude oh really yeah very like observ I love him like I I'm such a fan of him he has a very calming energy so do you like even on screen I'm saying yeah do you so do you maybe I mean I I don't really look at myself in third person I'm telling Youk one of my research bits that came out is brother massive female fan falling massive female fan following in Kerala girls love D no I think it's also the you know when you start out you kind of that romantic genre is is the space where most of us actors find our footing uh and then as you get older then you become more action whatever like you I feel like most actors have this journey why I don't know I think U uh at a certain age you know those stories just come to you you know you are the lover boy you're like oh I had a lot of this finding myself films a good bunch of them uh then it switched to uh romance I guess that maybe resonated with people are connected uh and that tag is stuck and I'm like now I just turned 4 and I'm like this next decade I can't be a romantic hero uh so I'm like I need to break out with that uh so right now I'm I'm sort of in that transition phase where I'm switching over to different genres nice yeah how are you looking the way you do at 40 I still have Grays that it adds to it so day one you know they did mascara and whenever I'm like in interviews I'm always like playing with it at the end of it my hands are black I'm like just forget it leave it it's okay just some Grace but I'm enjoying it I think you know I'd rather be here uh than in that sort of um not knowing in my 20s as to what or where I'll end up yeah one thing which has been a recent learning for me and such a cliche learning in life but I had to learn it again someone I was dating was an amazing person great relationship but I just felt like she was very sad on the inside because of her own past but she would really like cling on to that sadness of music choices were sad conversations were sad everything was about pain and sadness right and I'm a normal happy dude but I find myself thinking about my own dramas a lot more was it bringing you down unknowingly yeah yeah I think that happened and then later on I after we broke up I met my old friends I like I started seeing other people and I realized the world is a much happier place than my last few months were yeah uh and that made me understand that happiness is one of those things where you get to set the ceiling so in every moment you get to decide that no I want to be even happier and start finding joy in like small things start finding joy in like large things really celebrate happiness and when you do that on a regular basis you actually become happier yeah yeah I agree the reason I'm saying this is because you're a very happy guy I feel that Vibe a lot from you thank you thank you I think I think it's important right you should enjoy life I think uh I love what I do I think the only major conflict I'm going through now is being away from home I have a daughter who is six and that's been magical and you don't want to miss it's your need it's not their need as much as your need to like be there for the big moments and and see all of that you know uh so I'm very jealous of the other dads at school who who were able to go pick them up every day and who are constantly present I mean I'm on FaceTime and all the stuff but like you want to be there you want to be tactile that's the only conflict but your daughter gets to say my dad sexiest none of the other kids can compete yeah I think she does she does find a lot of excitement in in see when when I get recognized people come for photos andu there's a little Delight in her face how old is she she's six yeah yeah how have the six years of her life changed your life fully I think I think you know I was it's something I read some when when a child is born so are the parents right like you you also become a father for the first time you're born as a father or born as a mother in that moment so it is life-changing it is um and you know till then you think you know uh what love is uh what you feel for your mother what you feel for your father uh or your wife or your friends but trust me there is nothing like when you have a child as in the love you feel for that child is it's like it'll be like that you've never had that feeling in your life and I'm like okay this is what love is more than wife more than anything like I mean I'm sure she feels the same way like what you feel for your baby is like and this is why our parents have been the way they are with us you know uh in worrying all the time or uh and also always forgiving you know no matter what you can do the worst thing and your parents will find a way to forgive you because you're you're a part of them what should I know about my 30s because a lot of my friends it's either everyone's afraid about like all these aging weight gain hair loss or people are afraid about life and fatherhood or there's not too many people afraid about career fortunately in my circles but see usually usually I feel like that is the big concern no like career and money and all that like I feel like once you can remove that factor out of your life so many of the these other issues are very essentially first world issues right like there's especially in India you look around you and all of these people probably don't enjoy all of these other things because money is such a big factor or a job is such a big factor or like they're in a a rut you know constantly doing the same thing and unhappy about that and that unhappiness you know then spills over into your family or how you with your kids or your wife whatever so I'm like if you guys have this stuff sorted the rest is is not is not something to worry about I mean if you lose hair you can get a transplant uh if you gain weight you can you can train or Diet you know love love love the honesty yeah I know it's true I mean I feel like that these are things I don't think earlier Generations worried about these things image no they weren't worried about those things like like how I look if I'm fat if I'm if I'm losing hair or they had such I think India wasn't such a big economy at that time so much of this was making ends meet or whatever you know um ambition of building your house getting your your daughter married these were the big worries that they had I feel like our generation doesn't really have that you know we have so many more Avenues to to make a living or to earn and also uh we earn so much more comparatively you know like maybe today what I'm being because the business has changed so much what I'm being paid at my age as an actor Vis A what maybe my father was making at that time in India is world's apart I I say this with a lot of respect because I've grown up in a Cosmopolitan City okay bro so it's it's not coming from a wrong place but what I will say is I've always noticed that all my friends from the five southern states all can pick up languages like very easily but you know I think I think it's an Indian thing I think the average Indian knows 2 three languages two two3 is Chill you guys know like seven eight and all dude yeah we know as in typically malali will definitely find tamur easy and they will have some Bangalore exposure because of college or something and they will pick up a bit of Canada uh and then Hindi we have either in school or something so yeah three four languages you're right you're chill with Hindi like fully it was my second language uh and then the time I spent in in college uh all of us Indians from so many different states if we had to about any any foreigners or anything the common language is Hindi so we on on the bus you know and you want to pass comments like so that's easier right so then it became the common language so I think a lot of the times uh you know what we're conscious of uh in speaking Hindi or any language is is you're worried about an accent or you're worried about your diction or all of these things but when it becomes just a means of communication and you just have to communicate something oh when I Liv in Bombay and if I to speak to uh the auto driver or whoever I don't care about how I'm sounding you know so I think when you keep doing that you lose that fear and then it gets better and then I think uh your grasp on the language also gets better cuz a lot of the times it's you holding back um out of fear of judgment or ridicule or something uh but as you keep doing it and then and then you start to develop a year for it I okay this is where the accent is coming or this is where I sound uh like a non Hind the speaker uh so these are things I keep picking up I'm going to say something brutal dude not brutal for you it's nice for you it's just a brutal statement in general go for it I feel the Hindi film industry needs more dudes like you sweet yeah I don't know what to make of it as in you know I also feel like um it is a very big industry this one like in the is huge in the sense the re is so much more uh so much more eyeballs on this uh and I think Bombay just being this it's such a center of uh everything like Cinema industry finance and so I feel like there's so much happening here all the time there's so many events you know actors don't just end up going for film events uh so I feel like I I do feel like it's very different here so maybe um how they have to navigate this is quite different from maybe what how we do it back down south have you watched voided all these things like parties alcohol all all these things because of the inner good boy that you are you seem like a good B no I'm I'm social enough uh I do my time in chenai like you know it's it was always different CH was again a cosmol city coming from Ki and stuff so like definitely we had a great social life and school kids love to like go out all the time and but now I don't get the time as much cuz I'm never in one place uh but I but I do love meeting new people it's good I'm there's always something to learn there's always something I feel like I'm a sum of all the people I've met possibly it helps you as an actor also maybe yeah I mean I'm not I'm not constantly observing their mannerisms or their way of speaking I think I'm always seeking Knowledge from people uh I think my choice and or my knowledge of U music or the Arts or any of these things I have all come from um you know friends of mine or going to the houses seeing their parents book collection or their art collection because every house is different you know so I I strongly believe that I think um people have known have introduced me to different Cuisines or got me into food uh so even as of now even even I think if I'm doing a new film project and I meet somebody knew there this gentleman called um sain I forget his last name on guns and gulabs he plays M this my sort of sidekick Ram Prasad G and his son is this little MMA champ little MMA as in he's tiny he's like 12 13 or something like that they have MMA for kids yeah in Delhi apparently and he's kind of you know uh fighting above his age group and all that and and he's such an unassuming man this gentleman and so he's showing me videos and he's like he's like you know this kid just started seeing this on YouTube or something and he loved it and started practicing on his own at home uh and uh I was like what what do you mean he just taught himself he's like yeah literally he just he just kept practicing and practicing and practicing kept getting good and then finally he found there was a school somewhere and then he he asked us to take him there and we took him there and they were already impressed with what he knew and then they were like tweaking his skill like that's such a fascinating story practicing it on you and and sain S lives in Bombay his family is in Delhi and he's working here and uh he's only seeing most of this through his phone and it's so sweet and I didn't even know that like there's a uh you some could just pick up MMA from YouTube but I'm saying like you hear so much from people times are different man yeah you're like out and out a Family Guy like not not a Family Guy like like a family man I I think my I mean my home atmosphere has always been like that maybe okay and uh now we're at a stage where we all uh as in first when we younger we'd go travel as boys and then we all met our wives and then we all became friends together and then became couples traveling together and now it's like me and all of my friends have little girls it's like a massive girl gang there's like I think six or seven or more girls in in my different friend circles Al together now they're all friends and these kids are like they believe their cousins they believe their siblings so everybody has one elder sister or younger sister and put all those girls in a cage together and get them to do MMA dude we super strong girls come on yeah but it's great it's great just the thought get that such and K to go on girls need more female MMA fight I'm missing around I wish love upon your children but why not right like why not yeah it would be cool I mean I I I like my sister's always been influenced by me and my dad and stuff and like you know she's into cars or driving and everything because I'm into them and so it's always cool I think when when I when I when I see them doing things like that tell me about like your whole style Vibe dude like one of the most common things that comes up about you and someone Googles your name is one of India's most stylish men how do you look at it how and and I I agree it's and style is not just the way you dress or the way you keep your beard it's all of it put together and the energy and then how you let the energy dictate what the world sees on the outside I think um definitely always had an eye for detail uh from when I was young like I noticed every little thing like I and I like to see effort in anything uh like I walked into your room I was like I love the colors of the wall I'm noticing you know everything on your shelf and I'm like it speaks so much about you and you know it shows culture and all of the stuff does it say that I'm a up guy no no no it's it's it and it feels lived in you know a lot of the times people don't put anything out and you don't know the house doesn't speak about them uh and I think from when I was young like low angling my father you know and he was always stylish and he was always cool and he was always dressed really well and so I justed want want to dress like so as a like a freaking toddler or like when from when I could speak and walk I wanted to dress like a grown-up like my my I think four year 5y old self going to some school fancy dress party I want to wear a suit with a bae and all the stuff and you knew the ladies like all this no there nothing about the ladies I I was just like I want to dress I mean I think I was always like a bit of a dandy like I want to like be well turned out but dress like a grown-up not like a kid how does a brother become a better dressed man no understand I mean I think it's so important for us to understand our bodies you know you know what is your strong suit like what is if you have a certain type of shoulder or if you have a belly or whatever it is you dress according to that you know let's not highlight the bad sides you enhance the the good parts and that's the best thing about clothes you know anyone any body type can be well well dressed self-awareness yeah uh experimentation yeah and malayali genetics no what I you know we need to understand a bit about how clothes are cut and how they fall fit fit us and fall on us and stuff I see a lot of people sometimes wearing very expensive uh big label stuff but just not fitting them right you mean the vibe is also not right yeah it's off you know people are trying to say that listen you see this brand this is how much money I'm worth that's fine but below that if if that that that that shirt is hugging a belly or something that means you're bought the wrong size okay fair I've been relatively fit throughout my 20s very fit throughout my 20s suddenly you know I I do feel slightly weaker in some situations and you know when you're a kid watching football and some footballers turned 30 years old and you're like now he's old now he'll go to another club we are 30 now dude so you and you know randomly you start seeing X and pains uh you're like this wasn't there before uh why is my knee making this weird sound when I'm D downstairs that wasn't there before it happens very suddenly because in my head I'm still 16 years old yeah but I'm actually 30 how old are you in your head probably like something like yeah my late 20s I think late 20s I don't know this last 10 12 years of acting and marriage and and father all happened like that so I must be where I was right before I start I got into movies this whole thing about a guy's aging body I'm seeing it for the first time my friends also seeing it for the first what happens in your late 20s suddenly you start seeing yourself slightly weaker all that work in the gym doesn't translate to as many result as it did earlier you don't get away with like ear be like good I can get ripped in a week so it's fine I can Bing today or this holiday is fine I'll get back one week I'll be back no yeah yeah it's a brutal reality for guys dude like you have to learn it very fast I think it's waivers for women yeah yeah like it's much more intense the way the society is built but again it's not something to bring you down I mean like embrace it you know uh there's so much uh Joy like I said in the security of having found these other things you know so we should embrace that also like I I would not trade this for anything else like me being here at 40 uh is so much of a happier secure space than in those 20s where I was I thought it was going to be a complete failure and a disaster in life you know so I'm okay with the ex and pains and the graay and stuff how's 30's Health like like 30 health is good uh but maybe the first time uh I wore a neck brace cuz I used the wrong pillow and my neck got thrown off and I was like this never used to happen uh or the first time I had like um like a knee injury and I was like this is like u in my 20s if I did the same jump for the stunt could I have taken it uh is it because I was like 37:30 when that happened uh so yeah little things I think you start to um just become a little more careful about but self-confidence money like my 20s like you know I was I was I wanted to be this dead I wanted to ride motorcycles everywhere and uh I jumped off a plane all that stuff and today I'm just like hm you know I'm like I can be the best Rider same thing that my parents would tell me you can be the best Rider but what about the other guys what about traffic you know you start to think and then you when you have the responsibility of uh going back home or like you know thinking of your your family or your kids and stuff automatically that the Daredevil bit kind of takes a backseat you know okay so I'm sure like all of our fathers were also like this before we came along fair you know and now they're like the dads and like you know worried about how fast we drive and all this I get that now I understand where where they were then but all in all age 40 is much better than age 30 for me personally yes and it's not been the case for people you've seen no I don't I mean it's it's uh some people if everything has always been going great in their lives and age is the only thing that makes them upset aging you look dude definitely a lot of Fitness you know what like maybe you know I restore a lot of old cars and stuff so I'm like maybe I'm I'm going into preventive maintenance for the future like keep this head of hair there you know what do I do to like so if I if if I see someone I'm like you know is there something I can do to make sure like it stays like you know I don't want to add anything it's fine I like how it is but how do I make this last as long as I can we had we hadil sh on the on the show oh look at it you know and I told him State up dude you look even better now than at 40 absolutely absolutely I think you're on the similar path honestly I hope so I hope so what's the secret man uh I mean just doing what you love and I I think all of that is maybe just being true right true to yourself do you meditate or something like I actually want to try you know because of my overthinking um it doesn't come through I've been talking to you for a good half an hour 45 minutes now I haven't sens that energ you me somewhere um or at night and I will overthink the hell out of anything like I drive my family mad and they know me they know how I am and uh they like stop overthinking it's fine just leave it I'm like is this why that didn't work uh should I have done this differently or uh did I say no to a good film this is the synopsis of film what do you think of it I already said no but I don't know if I now I'm like regretting it do you think I should call them back this this drama is never ending okay I'll tell you my perspective on what you just said okay and this is based on the fact that I'm a Mumbai boy you grow up with multiple cultures and one common thing you experience in Mumbai when you're growing up here is dissection of cultures right so you'll have a Gujarati family talking about Tamil people and Punjabi people and Bengali people you'll have the bengalis doing the same thing with like other communities you know what the stereotype about malalis is what that yall are very smart that's the oh must be good at maths must be smart and then all my Malu friends also generally I can always go go 10 lers deep in conversation with them always right why are malali so smart like where does The Stereotype come from I I mean I think there's there's definitely a perception because of our literacy rates you know a lot of the times uh because we have 100% literacy in our state uh so I think education is always something that that is almost guaranteed that you have to do and I think we really flourish but a lot of the times I've noticed we flourish outside the state uh I've noticed that like whether it's the Middle East uh so if you look at all of our the best content writers and editors there'll be malalis all all your Publications in India uh or all of all of the nurses everywhere will be malalis uh so I I don't know maybe also maybe because of the size of the state you know it's everyone kind of knows everyone and like these things these values are maybe instilled and it just spread I don't I I can't really pinpoint when you're talking in malum with each other is the conversation just intellectual no it can be anything it can be anything oh my God there's so much of movies and movie dialogue references and all that stuff like so we really trip on uh you know the the all of the pop culture references of the '90s from all of our Cinema so okay it is it is almost part of our like daily parin like everybody everybody knows the reference point uh it's kind of made it into into the language now okay yeah tell me more what what do Malo talk about to each other is it offensive not at all not at all no uh I mean some some find it offensive but I'm like it's okay sorry sorry um but I realized that you know whenever we do catch up you you meet in Mal for the first time the first thing we both look at each other and say where are you from back home like we say not L you know now it's almost become a joke you know as soon as you say that we almost say hey that's like that's the we know that's the next question coming as oh M okay then where are you from back home uh that's a typical like ice breaker starter uh but generally I feel like movies are always discussed uh or something about uh the state maybe or like and also like it's not like keral is one big city right it's it's it's one big like uh it's all these towns uh that have almost along this great Road from north to south and each of us have a different dialect each of us have a different accent each of us have uh a different way of maybe preparing similar dishes uh so there are things we are discovering about each other or uh like when when it's not like two people from ker speak the same kind of malum uh so it's lovely in that sense like there is stuff to discover and learn and and uh enjoy about each other you know like I like the way he speaks Sports of course yeah what sport I think football is huge okay uh in Cricket in in Kerala Cricket I'm say in Kerala uh I I would even go as far as say like I think it's bigger than Cricket in Kerala just especially like malaba like North Kerala seven football is huge uh what football is followed like is it local football is it International International everything like uh during the World Cup it's like they thanked all the all the countries and Kerala like I think they thought Kerala is a country because so much love came from there so much of those videos really spread uh you know it's a lot of eppl um yeah eppl uh I think they just watch everything now I'm saying like when now locally they play sevens football uh and they have local um tournaments and stuff uh and to the point that they bring in players from Africa and all that within their own little budgets like you know their clubs they pull in money uh they'll get in players from elsewhere and and it's a it's a it's a so I wasn't I didn't grow up around that you know so when I was shooting in North Kerala it was insane it was like every house was painted uh you know there's U me kids are playing everywhere but like they're all wearing the jerseys or like but you could just see the town taking whichever color of whichever uh you know side they're supporting it's amazing yeah what should the rest of India know about Kerala like what what do you think is some misconception that people have um or something you'd like to change the perception of what is a misconception not everyone's good at maths yeah I'm sure I'm sure there's many of us will agree that you know we're probably bad at math uh but I think I think there's my favorite thing is about also because I always kind of looked at it with a nostalgic eye because I moved away when I was seven and it was uh it was always Kera is where I'd go for my summer vacations and uh when my mom and dad would live both both my grandparents lived in two different parts of the State uh not very far far apart but even their cultures are different so even if it's the same dishes if if with seafood like the prawns in my mom's house would be cooked differently and my dad's house be cooked differently there's crazy food in there crazy food I willou like you like Goen food you like Sri Lankan food K is right in the middle some of the best food I've had some of the best yeah so I that is something that I mean I don't know if it's a miscon people don't know about it but you know if you go there there is so much to discover food wise and you can go all around the state uh my mouth watering talking about and what's your favorite malali dish I definitely think uh so my my uh side of my part of like Ki and stuff has a lot of uh how do I explain it like you have to kind of see you you know like Hoppers and string Hoppers it's like upam and all you know we have something called patri patri is almost like a rice chapati very thin uh you literally can eat like 2 three at a time and then like coconut milk is a big part of our our meals and some great nonv curries you know either mutton or chicken or prawns or whatever and my house is a feast and my mother strongly believes it anything she feeds me I can't put on weight it can't affect my fitness so every time I come back home after a long break or SCAR or whatever it is like this massive feast and she's like I've made all your favorites I'm like M I'm an actor want die it'll show my face now she's like no no I made it you won't get fat don't worry I didn't put oil on it it's fine but uh yeah the food is insane as my friends have always had this doubt like dude how do you people in your house like how do you guys stay thin it makes no sense yeah I second that thought I've been to koi SE those Chinese fishing nets oh my God yeah isn't that beautiful it's like and it's so unique to the you get the whole God's own country Vibe only when you actually visit this is not a Kerala tourism we're just talking we forgotten the mics are there no but there I mean you want to go up to the hills you know you go to monar or like the backwaters and the beach and everything is there it's so I think we all are also quite aware uh of how blessed we are you're a very calm guy dude I'm someone who's diagnosed with ADHD so I have intrusive thoughts sometimes when I'm doing a podcast with people I visualize a train coming and running both of us over and all that's the curse of my which is why all these random questions are being thrown at wow okay but I mean I've I think um experience that once or twice just like what you're sitting around you randomly like I think when I was promoting like yesterday I I told this to ad she was sitting next to me I do you because I there's four of us talking so if you're not being asked a question when you're sitting there sometimes you drift off right some sit thinking I'm like what would be like if I just like killed over and collapsed like now or like or suddenly like I threw up or something would that be really weird Okay so after the things I'm looking likees do you get these kind of thoughts and he literally turned to me thinking it's something very relatable that I'm going to ask him he's like no bro that's all you he like that's all you none of us get thought like this so so you and you have intrusive thought I don't think when I'm sitting there like randomly like you maybe I'm I'm entertaining myself you know like I'm thinking of situations which would just be bizarre or absurd and I guess as artists we get to be kids for the rest of our lives in a way so it keeps your brain also kind of like a kid's brain I think so and I mean that's that's fun in that right like I I think that's why the ladies also love you cuz your inner child is very alive d maybe maybe why why do you think like you have such a big I've asked you this already but genuinely why do you think you have such a big female fan following other than the Romantic films and the calm demeanor see I I think this whole major female fan fan following discussion has been happening maybe post OK or or now and stuff but otherwise I have a solid like boy fan following in Kerala like the the the boys will take it very personally you keep saying sorry sorry because they the ones you know who who uh are there and like in Every Which Way like they they create the big posters and they are out there watching all the films and they will come uh and wait for me outside my house or like if I if I'm out for a drive they're like you know like riding alongside me and stuff so there is there's a crazy connect with them also but uh having said that I think there is people probably know that I'm I am who I am like this is this is how I am actually uh so I think in that there's a connect you know I'm not some I don't think they see me as some uh Untouchable some crazy un like I'm sitting in some Mountain uh I feel like when I'm on screen I think the connect with the audience they feel like they can touch me okay you know I think that I think that's is because I'm I've always been real I think people are very um aware that you're married yeah but do you have you still had any weird interaction where I see a lot of the times they they kind of see us as a unit it's very sweet like they'll I've had weird interaction with like slightly maybe older uh you know not aunties but like women who if I'm just taking a picture they like sneak a peck on my cheek or something like really cool fashionable one and I'm like hm not not very appropriate but whatever but it's sweet like you know it comes I think from a lot of how how do you feel when someone just lands up peck on your cheek sometimes it catches You by surprise right you're just like and you're just just posing for a picture so I'm not even looking there I'm I'm posing for the picture tuck it happens anyone's grabbed your ass or anything yes again an older uh lady I don't know why uh and it was it was very awkward very bizarre yeah like she was I was in pain and it wasn't it wasn't like that kind of a grab I don't know what and she was like way older right she dug her fingers and yeah like it's like this and I don't know what it meant and we were on stage and there's like a lot of people we all standing there and I was like oh a please come and stand so I've held her a lot of the times people don't know where to keep their hands you know like a lot of the times it's sometimes it's just on your behind but this I was like I was like that I was like in the pictures I'm trying to smile like why is this happening and I don't know how to get out of it it was bizarre oh my God I completely forgot about this yeah I have been in some situations where hands are placed in wrong places is and you don't know how to react taking pictures right your body almost freezes I can't change my expression now for this photo you're taking so why and and the person will be taking the photo will also take that little extra 3 seconds so the ass is I mean the hand is nicely placed on your ass for some time and you don't understand why there's so much of your back yeah yeah well what is the why I I I I know do it to some friends of mine as a joke I be like I'm like this is what I go through what are you doing like imagine this now explain to me why people do this but there's no answer I don't know what it is I think when Brotherhood crosses a certain threshold the lines of heterosexuality get a little BL get blur yeah uh I Bros relate Bros relate Bros relate fully um H I think you are being pretty sexualized I only these one or two incidents but yeah I can't imagine what famous women go through but all the famous men I know and I'm even talking about like Instagram creators everything everyone has had some kind of a sexualizing experience I don't know why possibly but yeah this is I think something I can remember Max like this the pain that I felt I was like what is going on do you think people like the fact that you're married or do you think it pisses people off I don't I don't honestly I don't think people are that invested you know they don't they're don't like oh like I mean see even when your favorite actress are like you know someone you find really attract to a heart or something gets married like what what is upsetting you like what did you think you had a chance no you don't have a chance like it's not going to happen you're you're not going to meet this person uh but I think people just like to say this like and it's sweet like you know they enjoy uh like some sometimes like I I'll be watching like a like a YouTube revieww or something uh I hm there too much romance in this hm I don't like how how he's getting so close to that and I'm like what but it is sweet I I think I think people enjoy that like way you feel like this person belongs to you in some way uh and that is also there there is there is ownership a lot of the times viewers have a certain ownership which is why sometimes they get upset you know if uh like they want a picture and and um you know you feel like you're looking like u a mess or something you're like not not and then but why why can't you take a picture CU suddenly you do belong to them in some way you know as actors or uh I think there is a sort of sense of weird ownership that people have and I think all this comes from that yeah Fair yeah how old were you when you got married 208 was it 28 yeah 28 right age for a guy weirdly all the men in my family have somewhere been around there and it was good I mean I I wish i' maybe uh been working a little before uh for sometime you know just kind of earning for myself and doing things on a whim you know going on a solo trip but things like which I can't do now um or I'll think 100 times because my time so limited uh I'm always like I should try and you know do the holiday with with with uh my wife and daughter cuz they don't get time with me and so some of those things I I wish I'd done maybe uh if I had that kind of money to spend you know go to some concert in Europe or something like you know that's 3day 4- day thing just go for a thing and come back but your girl was with you throughout your eyes then that's the flip side yeah I guess I guess that's a dream for a lot of dudes just saying every every guy dreams of marrying the girl who's with him when he's a nobody and then true with him at the top as well no no absolutely yeah sorry I I didn't get what you're saying initially but she did see me when I was when I had no no clue I just told her like when I when we met I was like uh uh I want to at least Act in one film and direct one film these two things are like my bucket list even if it's one film I want to act just know like if I can and I want to direct because I want to create something I want to tell something uh that's all I know and I don't think she fully understood any of this like uh her family is zero exposure to the industry or even a lot of regional cinema uh they're like Udu speaking so they probably know more of Hindi Cinema than regional cinema um but she's seen this every day you know and even when it's been growing even when it's been bad days uh and she's seen all of it and I think I think she balances me in that sense it answers my question about why you're so happy bro little bit no you know you need that grounding I think uh so if ever I act little bratty you know she has the sort of freedom to tell me that know I understand like you know things are going well and you're now the star but no calm down that's the blessing that's the blessing and the same school friends have that you know with me like they'll never treat me there's no uh separate Lane for me there's no nothing there's no extra PR they don't even look they don't even look at me with a different lens we still have the same conversations the same we joke about the same things or uh you know when we get together it's none of us really even talking shop nobody's discussing work and I love that I'm not trying to be intrusive with you at all so if you feel like not answering don't bro but I would actually like to know about your marriage just from a brotherly perspective because it's a phase I know I'm going to be heading into right myself so I want to know how your marriage evolved because I believe it was an arranged marriage is that's what Wikipedia says so I've told this marriage story a lot um but I mean we were both from the same school she was five six years my junior and u uh around this 26 27 I wasn't seeing anyone at that time uh and I started getting these Ras and stuff my mom was kind of like you know maybe it's time for you to settle down I'm getting these Ras do you want to explore and I don't know if I like that process uh and randomly I started bumping into my wife who I've never seen out in ch till then ever like she's not very social I just never like where like where do these kids hang out I've never seen them but a lot of people kept telling me about her they like you remember those uh you know uh a mile from school you're junior and you know why aren't you both meeting like we think there's there's definitely something there like could be a possible um chemistry pair chemistry or whatever um so when I started seeing her out and uh I think I saw her out three times in a week and I have this weird thing with three you know uh sometimes movies that come to me and uh I say no to it and then it comes back and again I say no to it and if it comes back like some three four times like that I'm like maybe there something I'm not seeing maybe these people are seeing me in it maybe I should do it so I was like okay I've never seen her out and suddenly I'm seeing her out so often uh maybe it's a sign maybe I should reach out so I very 2000s uh you know that era Facebook messager saying hi you know I don't know if you remember me from school and uh I'm getting all these Ras and I think I'm sure you're also going through that in your house and if you're not seeing anyone or whatever if you want to just grab a cup of coffee let's at least see if we get along and if it's terrible you know you would have just met a senior from school for coffee and that's it uh so she didn't reply for a couple of days and I was like uh like did I do something wrong did I cross the bline with somebody I don't know and which is very sweet she rep like no yeah no i' be open for it uh sure let's meet sort of thing uh so I guess we both kind of kept the parents in in the loop and being like you know we're going to meet uh and then see if there's something there sort of thing how did you know that this girl is your wife I don't know I don't know I think up until then anyone I dated or I met or knew I could see them maybe uh with my friends or when we're all hanging out or socialize or whatever I never saw any of them at home like I couldn't visualize some because I would always think of my family my extended family everything because we're so close it and there's so much of uh that bonding that we have and somehow like when I saw her I was like I just see her there something you can't like articulate it exactly I can't articulate I just feel like I could see her as a part of my world as a part of my family which i' never seen with anybody else and how does the relationship evolve over time like the longest I've dated someone is like three and a half four years so I don't yeah yeah up until then the same uh but also she was very young when we got married she was only like 23 or something um so she's grown up over time and uh it evolves in the sense see also it was it was a my 30s was essentially me having met someone uh me having taken this giant leap into this career and then trying to make that that um and kind of find each other and literally I came back from my honeymoon and I went straight to shoot my second film started and they waited only for my wedding to get done so we barely had a courtship uh we met and we were married 6 months later um and only so much I think our families allowed us to really um travel or not like we could take some holiday together and stuff so it was very uh meeting for coffee or going for a movie things like that so we got married and instantly like that's when you know we would have the freedom to do anything we want but that's exactly when I started my career so in that sense uh you know every little chance we got to hang together or spend time together or it meant a lot and I think we made the most of it so it's always been like long distance uh my entire marriage I think uh and that that works both ways doesn't it takes effort but you also start to like value the little things right even if you're just home and chilling with a movie playing or doing nothing would you value that you know I don't get to do it because I'm always living out of a suitcase and I'm in some hotel somewhere uh so I don't know what what would' be like if I had some 9 to5 job and I was always at home maybe you know I would driv her insane but I think because I'm always coming and going you know they say that every successful relationship contains one normal person and one crazy person is that I'm the crazy in this really yeah I think so bro you're such a good boy like so imagine her you know like I I I still like to go out a lot I love people around and um not like you know the general crowds or anything but like my my same friends left to me I would want them around all the time you know I always want to go out with them I always want them coming home I want my house to be full of people and uh she's not that like it's not like she's antisocial but like she likes to turn in early uh there's that thing you know like there's uh there'll be one person who uh sleeps at 10 and one person want to step out at 10 and then they get married so we're like that average is out if you could go back and tell that 28-year-old version of yourself something about relationships or about marriage what would you tell that 28y old version it's not just the wedding right A lot of people when they say I I want to get married I'm looking to settle down are always thinking of just the wedding like it's like it's in the movies you know it's wedding end of movie happily ever after and uh but what marriage is is definitely companionship uh is definitely you know having that one you know there was there was a a line of film have you seen Shall We Dance no watch that film it's a good film so she Susan sandon says this line where she's like we do you know why we get married or we have a partner uh is so there is someone with you to witness your everyday like every little thing that happens in your day it shouldn't go noticed someone should witness it it can be something as silly as what did you eat for lunch uh or I sprain my toe today I stub my toe today or something the the most trivial of things that happen to you you're not sharing that every day with your parents or your kids or anything I think whoever is your uh partner on this ride called life is the only witness to to your every day have you cried in front of your wife yeah how many times like I the big moments right like the big like whenever I I get emotional every time a film exceeds my expectation uh why bro I don't know I think because I put in so much and maybe had so much self-doubt you know if I'll make it as an actor uh or if I'll make it as a there's always some something that you can't attain somebody will say you but you don't have this but you don't have that you don't have some 100 Crow film you don't have some 50 grow something you know uh it's not like I chase numbers but you're talking about a human occurrence dude it's then throughout no so I'm saying so my point I don't understand why I get emotional but like so and you hear a script and you see a film in your head a lot of the times filmmakers don't see the same film that's where there's a mismatch some people like why did you choose this film and I'm like I I saw it differently in my head maybe he saw it differently and sometimes it matches and that's a great thing but sometimes it goes beyond that that I find like Destiny was at play I don't know I'm like it's it's so overwhelming for me I'm like oh my God I only damed this much for this film I thought it' be this great but it is that great freaking God you know so those those moments for me on that release day When I See This Joy and stuff like I've broken down out of Joy just like a happy something but you feel like you need to like let it out ever out of sadness no it was not I mean sad is obviously like if there's if there's some loss in the family or something like that but not not for anything else uh but usually it's these things like when I got my first state award you know like I and it's not like some happy te thing but I literally like break down uh which I think it's good I mean I think it's healthy like it should come out but she's witnessed out of that you're a blessed guy yeah I I do feel blessed when that happens a lot of the people who sit in that seat in front of me are very blessed and there some people are just holding that extra 10% of blessings and I say this very like genuinely man I'm not just saying that thank you you can tell a blessed person when you hear them speak and when you hear about their life and how humble they still are despite the success like you know you're constantly crediting it to not yourself uh there is still self-doubt which you know sometimes a small amount of that you need it no like um just to push yourself more like I don't know if I if I was supremely conf I mean I'm always a little jealous of people who are so confident uh but I think I think it's my self-doubt or like uh fear of not doing Justice to a role or a film that stuff drives me a lot what I feel respect towards you for is this whole family angle in just the world of Glamour I don't think the family angle is celebrated as much as you seem to be celebrating it as in what I've gotten to know about you the guy in you like I always knew about the brand DQ but I I'm when I'm talking to you I see how much it's in your heart and that's what I also really aspire to have in life honestly man so when you see an older guy who's had a flourishing career and values like family life and is a good dad good husband uh I think those are goals for a lot of guys who entering in the 30s yeah so thank you brother you're most welcome brother uh but I mean it's interesting because I um like when when you speaking to me with that perspective where uh it's almost like brotherly advice I'm giving I never thought I would ever do that so that's great you never thought You' do what as in be in a place to give a younger brother advice you know what I'm saying um like I was always the younger kid I always an elder sibling uh so I never thought like I would like I know there are friends of mine or younger friends of mine who who do seek my thoughts or my advice on things or uh see me as a mentor and I've no fully understood it I'm like I'm only still figuring things out I'm I'm I'm still learning uh I don't know if I have it in me to Mentor anybody but maybe there is a perspective of me that I'm not seeing uh but it it is it is a nice feeling So yeah thank you for that the perspective is that I feel 8s born guys especially mostly only J ker right '90s Born guys mostly only Chase career even more so it's nice to see an 8s born guy balance out his life because I see a lot of my 80s born Brothers with troubled personal lives and all and you know you're a very stable dude and reflects on your face so and I mean like also through conversation and all all that but this is goals dude like I think when I was 22 my goals were to have a stable career that's it 25 it's about money and like magnanimity and now that I'm 30 it's about what you have stable family life I mean with all the money you've earned and it's great initially that you you buy all the things you thought you couldn't buy but I feel like Beyond a point you're only buying multiples of the same thing right you have one car you have three you have one house you have two one watch you have 10 watches so I think the best way to spend your money is on experiences on travel and and all of that and I think once but as as as I mean speaking for boys because we're boys and we can understand I think it is important for us to prove this to ourselves that hey I made it hey I I I made this money that I was chasing or whatever and I I bought these things that I wanted to buy and once you get there and you're fine you're done you know and I see this in my dad I see these in um senior actors after a point they're done buying they're like it's okay now now I don't care I know I can so it's fine so I think we're almost at the end of this episode man this has been fun it's been uh uh I mean you've gotten me to think and uh even I kind of look back on on my life a lot which is great yeah I think people watch these pieces with famous humans to read between the lines they're studying your silences they're studying where you hesitate with an answer Etc that's where you get to to actually see the person's character yeah that's what people connect with now the raw form of uh whoever is sitting in that seat man right uh I don't know how's it been for you I mean it's it's different from anything else I think um it's easy to connect with you uh like you like I said like you said I mean I like your Vibe I like your energy um and I always thought I was a good listener but you're clearly a very good listener you know why I'm a good listener cuz this show started four years ago and right before that had a bad breakup and one of the reasons she gave me is and you're not even a good listener so I was like really I'm going to turn it into a career so so now she can never say that again uh all I'll say is here we are uh man DQ brother thank you I really appreciate you uh I have a strong gut feeling this is not the last time we'll ever have a conversation awesome I look forward to it yeah I agre and and I hope it's in uh different intervals where you know like like maybe I'm going into another decade or you're going and we have a little more experience to discuss we actually had scheduled you for tomorrow again I'm messing around bro I'm messing around going to let you grow along your organic path uh going to let you accumulate all those experiences keep evolving you're a very evolving oriented human and that's not something I take for granted because uh again it's not easy to live the kind of life you're living but on the surface it looks like it is pretty easy for you and that says a lot about your character man so I appreciate you I'm glad I met you that positive energy red off I just wish you all the best brother thank you so much thank uh I will
